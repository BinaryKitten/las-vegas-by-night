          Mortal History of Las Vegas
        </h3>

        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="desert">
          Desert Foundations and Manifest Power (Pre 1905)
        </h4>

        <p class="content__body">
          The Southern Paiute and Ancestral Pueblo peoples followed the valley‚Äôs
          scattered oases for centuries, moving with the seasons. They left
          petroglyphs older than any city plan and pathways mapped in memory.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          In 1829, the Mexican trader Antonio Armijo led a caravan along the Old
          Spanish Trail. His scout, Rafael Rivera, found the artesian wetlands
          and named them Las Vegas, ‚ÄúThe Meadows.‚Äù It was a promise masquerading
          as geography.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          After that came the Americans: Kit Carson, John C. Fr√©mont, mapping
          trails for conquest. Mormon missionaries under William Bringhurst
          tried to mine the earth and farm the springs in 1855. By 1857, famine,
          insects, and conflict drove them out. A few settlers like Daniel and
          Ann Bonelli remained in the broader region, stubborn enough to stay.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          By 1866, the U.S. simply redrew the map, transferring the valley from
          Arizona Territory to Nevada without asking anyone who lived there.
          Even so, it remained nearly empty on paper: the 1900 census counted
          only thirty residents, clustered on a single cattle ranch where
          livestock outnumbered people.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The desert doesn‚Äôt forget. It waits. And its water would be sold
          again, at a far higher price.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="rail">
          From Rail to Real Estate (1905‚Äì1940)
        </h4>

        <p class="content__body">
          The city‚Äôs official birth date is May 15, 1905: a townsite auction
          orchestrated by mining magnate and railroad baron William A. Clark. He
          wasn‚Äôt selling land so much as selling promise. Clark‚Äôs railroad, the
          San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad, needed a desert oasis
          to water its engines and its men. Las Vegas‚Äô artesian springs were
          perfect.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          He bought the rights, built the depot, and sold lots in tidy grids,
          all under the watchful eye of railroad lawyers. By 1911, the town was
          incorporated, its future laid out in ink and ambition.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Growth was slow but steady and sordid. Even after Nevada outlawed
          gambling in 1910, the games didn‚Äôt stop. Backroom casinos thrived.
          Brothels operated with polite nods from local law. Las Vegas learned
          early that the frontier‚Äôs real currency was looking the other way.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Then came 1931. Gambling was re-legalized statewide in a single stroke
          of Depression-era desperation. Vegas didn‚Äôt need to build a vice
          economy; it just turned the lights on.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          And the Hoover Dam sealed the deal. Thousands of workers poured in,
          paid in federal dollars and looking for anything to dull the dust and
          loneliness. Las Vegas obliged: cheap rooms, easy divorces, plenty of
          drinks, and all the entertainment money could buy.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          During the Great Depression, the rest of the country scraped by. Las
          Vegas thrived, a city that sold sin in neat packages and learned to
          call it progress.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="mob">
          Mobbed Up and Lit Up (1940s to 1960s)
        </h4>

        <p class="content__body">
          World War II pumped life and money into the Mojave. Defense plants in
          Henderson churned out magnesium for bombs. Airfields sprouted and were
          repurposed into what would become Nellis Air Force Base. Military
          contracts brought paychecks. Paychecks brought people.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          With air conditioning making the desert livable year-round, Las Vegas
          wasn‚Äôt just a stopover anymore, it was a promise you could live in. By
          1950, the population had nearly tripled.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Organized crime saw opportunity like sharks smell blood in water.
          Legalized gambling was the perfect laundering machine. In 1946, Bugsy
          Siegel‚Äôs Flamingo opened with Hollywood flair and underworld
          financing. Siegel died for it a year later, shot in his girlfriend‚Äôs
          Beverly Hills home, but his vision survived him.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          And Vegas ran with it. The Thunderbird. The Desert Inn. The Sands. The
          Sahara. The Riviera. Neon cathedrals to vice, each one brighter,
          gaudier, hungrier than the last. Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and
          Elvis Presley weren‚Äôt just entertainment, they were camouflage, a
          glamorous mask over mob accounting books.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The 1950s added an even darker flourish: atomic tourism. The Nevada
          Test Site‚Äôs mushroom clouds lit the horizon like the devil‚Äôs
          fireworks. Tourists gathered for dawn picnics to watch the end of the
          world, sold as patriotic spectacle.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          By 1966, the city was changing again. Billionaire recluse Howard
          Hughes moved into the Desert Inn and started buying the Strip piece by
          piece. Where mobsters had built it, corporations would soon take over,
          trading broken knees for boardrooms, but never losing sight of the
          money.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="corporate">
          Corporate Takeover (1970s to 2000s)
        </h4>

        <p class="content__body">
          By the late 1950s, the state had seen enough bad headlines. The Nevada
          Gaming Commission launched its ‚ÄúBlack Book,‚Äù banning notorious
          mobsters from casinos to clean house, at least in appearance.
          Enforcement tightened. Backroom threats became boardroom strategies.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Enter Howard Hughes: billionaire, recluse, and unlikely messiah of
          corporate respectability. From his penthouse fortress in the Desert
          Inn, Hughes bought casinos in cash-heavy deals that skirted regulators
          but passed muster as legitimate. He wasn‚Äôt moral, just meticulous. He
          traded broken kneecaps for shareholder reports.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          This set the stage for a new era of predators. By the 1980s,
          visionaries like Steve Wynn weren‚Äôt just building casinos, they were
          manufacturing fantasies. Wynn‚Äôs Mirage opened in 1989, complete with
          erupting volcanoes and white tigers. It wasn‚Äôt just gambling anymore,
          it was an immersive, family-friendly spectacle.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The MGM Grand fire in 1980 was a setback, a reminder that dreams burn
          fast. But it didn‚Äôt slow the city for long.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Throughout the 1990s, the Strip transformed into a postmodern fever
          dream of consumption. Themed megaresorts like the Venetian and
          Bellagio turned the desert into a carnival of stolen identities:
          Renaissance canals, Parisian skylines, Egyptian pyramids, all packaged
          for profit.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          By the end of the decade, Las Vegas had passed one million residents.
          What started as a desert waystation was now a shimmering empire of
          illusion, carefully branded as wholesome entertainment while draining
          every dollar, every secret, and every drop of desire it could find.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="surveillance">
          Surveillance City (2010s to 2020s)
        </h4>

        <p class="content__body">
          The 2010s saw Las Vegas quietly evolve into one of the most
          intensively monitored urban areas in the United States. While New York
          and Chicago dominate in raw camera volume, Las Vegas stands apart due
          to the density and integration of its surveillance systems,
          particularly within the private sector.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Casinos led the innovation curve. Major gaming resorts on the Strip
          were among the first to deploy facial recognition, RFID tracking
          chips, and predictive surveillance technologies at scale, not just for
          fraud prevention, but for behavior profiling and high-roller analysis.
          These technologies became more invasive and precise with each upgrade,
          influencing both consumer experience and corporate control.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          In parallel, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD)
          began working closely with Homeland Security Fusion Centers,
          integrating commercial surveillance with federal intelligence
          workflows under the umbrella of counterterrorism and major event
          safety. The presence of high-profile conventions, large-scale tourist
          events, and casino security demands fostered an ecosystem where public
          and private surveillance merged fluidly.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Las Vegas doesn‚Äôt top the list for sheer number of cameras, but it
          ranks among the highest in per capita surveillance intensity, with an
          environment in which most visitors are monitored from the moment they
          exit McCarran International Airport to their final slot machine spin.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The Kindred of Las Vegas, what remains of them, know this. In Kindred
          terms, Vegas isn't just a Rack. It's a panopticon. Cameras don‚Äôt
          blink. Algorithms don‚Äôt forget. And someone, perhaps mortal, perhaps
          not, is always watching.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Many believe that sometime between 2011 and 2015, a full-scale Second
          Inquisition operation occurred under the radar of mortal awareness.
          There was no single flashpoint, no obvious massacre. Instead, a slow,
          systemic extermination, a bureaucratic purge labeled ‚ÄúSheepfold.‚Äù
          Official records cite disappearances, false identities, and corporate
          restructuring. The Kindred know better. They were erased.

          Kindred History of Las Vegas
        </h3>

        <p class="content__body">
          A city of opportunity. Sanctuary. Betrayal. Cleansing fire. If you‚Äôre
          new here, listen close. Because this city remembers what we try to
          forget.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="camarilla">
          The Camarilla‚Äôs Gilded Mirage (Pre-2010)
        </h4>

        <p class="content__body">
          For most of the 20th century, Las Vegas was ours. A jewel in the
          American Camarilla‚Äôs crown, glittering and obedient.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Don‚Äôt be fooled by the neon, it was the Ventrue who kept the lights on
          and the blood flowing. Prince Benedic ran it with a velvet glove over
          a steel ledger. He wanted quality, not chaos. The city‚Äôs Kindred
          population was kept small on purpose. Twenty or so permanent residents
          at any time. Plenty of visitors, sure, but always under strict rules.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          No feeding on casino owners. No skimming the mob‚Äôs take. Don‚Äôt make
          noise. Even poker was banned for Kindred because mortals notice who
          never loses. And no one was allowed to lose more than ten million
          dollars at the table in a single night. Scrutiny kills empires.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The Sheriff, Geoffrey Alan Montrose, was Nosferatu. Old. Patient.
          Unblinking. He saw everything that mattered and let the rest rot in
          the desert.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Other clans had their pieces of the Mirage. The Tremere had their
          chantry here, complete with rituals to keep out foreign bloodlines
          like the Kuei-Jin. The Giovanni (especially the Rothsteins) handled
          death and debt, laundering both with equal care. Nosferatu ran
          surveillance through the sewers and obsolete tech no mortal ever
          questioned.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Caitiff existed in tolerated shadows. Even Ravnos drifted through
          before their diaspora. It was a masquerade haven wrapped in vice, sin
          on tap, as long as no one noticed the blood in the drinks.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading">The Anarch Drift</h4>

        <p class="content__body" id="anarch">
          But Vegas was never meant for hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          This city celebrates transience. The promise of reinvention. The
          thrill of escape. That energy seeps into us. So the Anarchs came. Some
          just passed through, sampling the city's excess. Others stayed,
          slipping into cracks Benedic‚Äôs rules couldn‚Äôt reach.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">The real turning point? The Voerman twins.</p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Jeanette and Therese didn‚Äôt just move The Asylum from Santa Monica,
          they unleashed it here. Structured chaos. Ritualized seduction.
          Kindred came for a drink and woke up with a Blood Bond or a death
          sentence. Jeanette made headlines with her so-called ‚ÄúVegas Weddings,‚Äù
          Embracing mortals after a weekend of bad decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          They flaunted Camarilla laws without outright breaking them. And
          Benedic, ever the accountant, decided their chaos was cheaper to
          tolerate than suppress.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content__subheading" id="sabbat">
          Sabbat Incursions & False Flags

        <p class="content__body">
          Of course, where vice flourishes, the Sword of Caine follows.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The Sabbat didn‚Äôt hold territory here for long. They tried. Packs out
          of Southern California raided our infrastructure, aiming to claim the
          Strip. When they weren‚Äôt butchered outright, they masqueraded as
          Anarchs, worming into coteries until someone noticed the smell.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          We executed infiltrators without trial. That was the way.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          But it wasn‚Äôt clean. A raid in the late 1990s led to Fremont Street
          going dark for nights, the Strip locked down tighter than a vault.
          Blood hunts in the desert that even the Sheriff didn‚Äôt talk about.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Rumors linger. The Sabbat didn‚Äôt just leave. They left something
          behind. And no one agrees on what.

          Ask anyone who survived: the city didn‚Äôt fall. It was erased.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Between 2011 and 2015, Las Vegas vanished from Kindred maps. Mortals
          noticed nothing. The lights stayed on. The shows went on. But for us?
          Silence.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          The Second Inquisition called it a Sheepfold. That‚Äôs bureaucratic
          jargon for ‚Äúfully cleansed.‚Äù No shootouts on the Strip. No screaming
          in the news. Just... disappearance.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          Arrests that don‚Äôt show up in any system. Security footage that simply
          stops existing. Elysiums empty overnight.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">Benedic? Gone.</p>
        <p class="content__body">Montrose? Believed destroyed.</p>

        <p class="content__body">
          Even the Rothsteins went to ground. And Kindred sold each other out,
          hoping to survive one more night.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          We know the name they used for it in their records: SHEEPFOLD / LV-09.

        <p class="content__body">
          Anarchs have flooded in, seizing territory not through decree but

        </p>
        <p class="content__body">

          while her sister sets it on fire.
        </p>
        <p class="content__body">
          A new power whispers through it all, the House. If you want to feed
          safely on the Strip these nights, you pay them. Or you vanish. Vegas

        <p class="content__body">
          And then there‚Äôs Victor Manelli. Mortal. Mafia. Peacekeeper.
          Kingmaker. His rule is simple: Don‚Äôt interfere with his business.
          Those who do, Kindred or kine, don‚Äôt get found.

        <p class="content__body">
          Vegas isn‚Äôt a city of Princes anymore. It‚Äôs a city of ghosts,
          illusions, and unburied ambition. And the Masquerade here? It‚Äôs
          fragile as spun glass, and more essential than ever. You want to
          survive here now? You‚Äôd better learn the rules. Because the old ones
          burned with Benedic‚Äîand what replaced them is meaner, leaner, and
          nowhere near as polite.
